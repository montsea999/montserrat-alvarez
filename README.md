### After starting to study geological engineering, validate the subjects passed and transfer my expedient and continue my studies in Geology, and end up working in in the banking sector for fourteen years, I decided in 2019 to train more seriously in Web Development, because I am passionate about ❤️ ❤️ , and I'm excited about the idea of earning a living working on what I'm passionate about, if possible. 🍀🤞🙂

### I must say that I thought it would be easier, and that by pulling the thread, there are more and more possible routes, which I cannot cover ... So I have come to think at certain times ... What am I doing? ?, hehe‍

## `Hobbies `🤿🏄‍♀‍🧗🏼‍♀‍🎷💃 🧘‍♀‍🏀 🤸‍♀‍🤿🏄‍♀‍🧗🏼‍♀‍🎷💃 🧘‍♀‍
I am passionate about sports and nature, and if the two things can be together, better: running, skating, climbing, surfing, practicing yoga and anything else that may be a challenge for me (I even was a volunteer in a rescue exercise at sea, held by a cable from a helicopter)... And of course, train in different technologies has also become a hobby, because I enjoy learning and I am always looking for new challenges.

I am currently in an ERTE situation, and I continue to train in both Front End Development and Web Design
