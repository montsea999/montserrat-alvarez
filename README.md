### 👋 Hi, this is Montserrat Álvarez from Barcelona. 

![gif avatar saludando](https://github.com/montsea999/inspirations/blob/master/assets/gifavatar.gif) 

### After studying geological engineering for a year, validating and going on to study Geology, and ending up working in the banking sector for fourteen years, I decided in 2019 to take a turn to train in Web Development, because I am passionate about it ❤️❤️ and I´m doing my best to earn a living with it if it is possible 🍀🤞🚀 

### I must say that I thought it would be easier, and that as I pulled the thread, there are more and more possible routes, which I cannot cover ... So I have come to think at certain times ... what am I doing ??🏄‍♀‍ hehe

### but it lasts a second ... and immediately I start to think about the next thing that I am going to see...... Right now, my training in the sector is as follows:

## `Hobbies `
I am passionate about sports and nature, and if the two things can be together, better: running, skating, climbing, surfing, practicing yoga and anything else that may be a challenge for me (I even was a volunteer in a rescue exercise at sea, held by a cable from a helicopter) ... 
... And of course, training has also become a hobby, because I enjoy learning and I am always looking for new challenges.

I am currently in an ERTE situation, and I continue to train in both Front End Development and Web Design
